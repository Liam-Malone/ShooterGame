# TODO:

#### highest priority

- [ ] implement concept of "camera"
    - use with limited window first to ensure it works
    - have some rect offscreen and try to move to it
    - move camera by keeping player centre of screen
        - later adjust this so that screen moves when player reaches a certain distance from the centre
- [ ] add level generation
    - map different 'tiles' to colors - replace with proper textures later
    - [ ] improve level generation (maybe add underground??)
