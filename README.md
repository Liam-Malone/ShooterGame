# Shooter Game

I'm making a simple 2d shooter game

Something for me to toy with 2d game dev stuff

> I have no idea how far I'll be taking this

## Getting Started

### Compiling yourself

I will not be providing binaries/packages until this project is in a more complete state

Dependencies:

- Zig v0.11.0
- SDL2
- SDL_image
- SDL_ttf
- SLD_mixer

Building:
```console
$ zig build run
```
> I have yet to test compiling on windows

To run this, you will need to clone the repo and compile and run on your machine
