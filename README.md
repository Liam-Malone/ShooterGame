# Shooter Game

I'm making a simple top-down 2d shooter game -- or at least it's a shooter for now, might change further along

This thing is really just something for me to toy with 2d game dev stuff.

> I have no idea how far I'll be taking this

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

I have made many changes to the map-related code within the game-tools/map-editor subdirectory that are not yet implemented in the main game code.
To run the map editor, you can compile and run it from the game-tools/map-editor directory

## Getting Started

If you want to play this (I must warn, it's not really in a playable state yet) you can compile it and run it for yourself.


### Build From Source

If I do every provide a bindary, it will not be until this project is in a much more complete-looking state

Dependencies:

- Zig v0.11.0
- SDL2
- SDL_image
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_mixer

Building:
```console
$ zig build run
```
> I have yet to test compiling on windows
